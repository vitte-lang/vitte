- Improve editor tooling (VS Code, Vim, Emacs, Nano)
- Expand stdlib coverage (I/O, fs, net, crypto)
- End‑to‑end build for VitteOS targets

## Mid Term

- HIR/MIR hard typing improvements
- Better pattern matching and diagnostics
- More platform backends and targets
- Packaging and install scripts

## Long Term

- Self‑hosting milestones
- Robust module system and namespaces
- Formal spec and standard library docs

# Vitte VS Code extension (local)

This folder is a minimal VS Code extension that provides:
- Syntax highlighting for `*.vitte`
- Basic editor configuration (brackets, comments)

## Install

1. Open this repo in VS Code.
2. Open the Command Palette → `Developer: Install Extension from Location...`
3. Select `syntax/vscode-vitte`

The repo already maps `*.vitte` to the `vitte` language in `.vscode/setting.json`.

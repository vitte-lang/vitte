#
# Export allowlist for ABI baseline tooling.
#
# Format:
# - One rule per line.
# - Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.
# - Rules are matched against the *exported* symbol name.
# - A trailing '*' means prefix match.
# - Otherwise the rule is an exact match.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep this file stable; changes should be reviewed alongside ABI baselines.
# - Prefer prefix rules over enumerating every symbol.
# - Denylisting is handled by the ABI baseline policy (e.g. '__', '_').

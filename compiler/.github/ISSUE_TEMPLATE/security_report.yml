        **Do not disclose security issues publicly.**

        This repository uses **private** reporting for security vulnerabilities.

        ## How to report

        1) **Preferred:** Use GitHub’s **Private Vulnerability Reporting** (Security Advisories)
           - Go to the repository **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**.

        2) If Private Vulnerability Reporting is not available:
           - Open a new issue **only** if maintainers explicitly requested it.
           - Otherwise, contact maintainers via the security channel described in `SECURITY.md`.

        ## What to include

        - A clear description of the vulnerability and impact
        - A minimal reproduction (PoC) or detailed steps
        - Affected versions / commits
        - Environment details (OS/arch/toolchain) if relevant
        - Any known mitigations or suggested fix

        ## Response expectations

        - Maintainers will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible.
        - Please do not publish details until a fix and advisory are released.

        ## Safe disclosure

        If you have already disclosed details publicly, **remove them immediately** and use private reporting.

        Thanks for helping keep Vitte secure.

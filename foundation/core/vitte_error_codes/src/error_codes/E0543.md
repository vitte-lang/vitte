The `note` value is missing in a stability attribute.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0543
#![feature(staged_api)]
#![allow(internal_features)]
#![stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "test")]

#[stable(since = "0.1.0", feature = "_deprecated_fn")]
#[deprecated(
    since = "1.0.0"
)] // invalid
fn _deprecated_fn() {}
```

To fix this issue, you need to provide the `note` field. Example:

```
#![feature(staged_api)]
#![allow(internal_features)]
#![stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "test")]

#[stable(since = "0.1.0", feature = "_deprecated_fn")]
#[deprecated(
    since = "1.0.0",
    note = "explanation for deprecation"
)] // ok!
fn _deprecated_fn() {}
```

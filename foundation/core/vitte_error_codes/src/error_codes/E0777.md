A literal value was used inside `#[derive]`.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0777
#[derive("Clone")] // error!
struct Foo;
```

Only paths to traits are allowed as argument inside `#[derive]`. You can find
more information about the `#[derive]` attribute in the [ Book].


```
#[derive(Clone)] // ok!
struct Foo;
```

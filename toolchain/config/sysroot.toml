# toolchain/config/sysroot.toml
#
# Vitte toolchain – sysroot profile (explicit sysroot + include/lib roots).
#
# Merge on top of default.toml + target preset.
# Intended for cross-compilation or hermetic/native builds where the SDK/sysroot
# is pinned explicitly instead of discovered (xcrun/NDK/etc).
#
# IMPORTANT:
#  - Set sdk.sysroot to an absolute path.
#  - Keep include/lib roots optional; clang will often locate them under sysroot,
#    but explicit roots are useful for custom layouts.

----

The `unboxed_closures` feature allows you to write functions using the `"-call"` ABI,
required for implementing the [`Fn*`] family of traits. `"-call"` functions must have
exactly one (non self) argument, a tuple representing the argument list.

[`Fn*`]: ../../std/ops/trait.Fn.html

```
#![feature(unboxed_closures)]

extern "-call" fn add_args(args: (u32, u32)) -> u32 {
    args.0 + args.1
}

fn main() {}
```

/*
 * Vitte diagnostic contextual-help subsystem.
 *
 * This module turns structured diagnostic information into conservative,
 * actionable remediation guidance.
 *
 * The diagnostic registry remains authoritative for diagnostic identity and
 * metadata. This file owns remediation policy.
 *
 * Principles:
 *
 *   - stable public diagnostic codes drive generic remediation policy;
 *   - explicit HELP annotations always have priority;
 *   - structured semantic information refines generic policy;
 *   - source excerpts are used only when they are safe and exact;
 *   - no source-specific fact is invented;
 *   - no automatic conversion is recommended unless its intent is known;
 *   - no fix-it is fabricated here;
 *   - output remains deterministic;
 *   - malformed diagnostics must not crash help formatting;
 *   - UTF-8 source text must never be split;
 *   - terminal control characters are never copied into generated help;
 *   - C17.

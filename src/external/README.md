# External Dependencies

This directory contains external dependencies and submodules required for the Vitte compiler:

- **gcc/**: GCC toolchain integration
- **llvm-project/**: LLVM compiler infrastructure (used by code generation backends)

These are typically large submodules that are managed separately.
